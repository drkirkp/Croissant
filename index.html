      Across various accounts of croissant history, most sources agree that it
      originates from Austria as the kipferl. Made from a yeasted wheat dough,
      the kipferl is a baked bread roll common in Central Europe. Records state
      that the kipferl has been around as early as the 13th century, but many
      believe it may be even older. Popular myths attribute its invention as a
      celebration of the Ottoman Empire’s defeat in the Battle of Vienna; the
      crescent shape represented the moon on the Ottoman flag.
